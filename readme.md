This project is my personal project and personl reference. In the long run I might continue this during free time. I plan to make this 3 in 1 package (HR, School Enrollement, and School Cashier). I use Laravel, Vue.js, and adminLTE for this project.

To install this you need to:
1. git clone https://github.com/rhensshuya23/laravel_vue.git
2. composer install
3. npm install
4. php artisan key:generate
5. copy .env.example to .env (make sure you have a file .env or create one)
6. php artisan migrate
7. php artisan db:seed
8. php artisan passport:install --personal
9. php artisan serve
